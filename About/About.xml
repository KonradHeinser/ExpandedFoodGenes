Expanded Biotech Style Genes(EBSG) is the step beyond [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2985153870]More Biotech Style Genes[/url]. Where that series sought to expand ranges that already exist, this series seeks to add ranges that should exist. You get gene ranges that alter sleep fall rate, but why not a range for changing the rate it recovers? If you can have fire resistance genes, why not have genes to resist other types of damage like frostbite and acid?

For this episode, I have cooked for you the most boring food genes. For our main dish we have 5 new options for food poisoning chances, a 250%, a 200%, a 150%, a 66%, and a 33%, and for a side I have prepared some max nutrition genes that multiply max nutrition by 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5. And for dessert, we will all be glad that I ran out of ideas on how to continue this terrible metaphor. I regret some of my life choices now.

This mod will eventually be put into Expanded Biotech Style Genes - All in One. If that mod exists and you still see this message, please let me know I forgot to add the link here.
